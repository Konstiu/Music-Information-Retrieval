We built upon the foundation of our work in Milestone 2.1, reusing key components such as file loading, spectrogram computation, and the generation of constellation maps. Expanding on this groundwork, we have now implemented an audio identification system using the fingerprinting technique.\n",

    "In this implementation, we focus on selecting anchor points and defining corresponding target zones from the peaks of the constellation map. We then compute the hashes and store them in a dictionary for efficient matching. To validate our approach, we experimented with four different configurations. We first conducted small-scale tests using the dataset from Milestone 2.1 and then extended our evaluation with an additional 60 tarballs (=34 thousand songs)\n",

    "## Matching a single query\n",
    "\n",
    "In this implementation, we created a function, find_best_match_for_query, to match a single query audio track against a database of audio fingerprints. Following the method outlined in the Shazam paper for audio fingerprinting, we utilized a combination of hashing and offset analysis to identify the most likely match. Here's what we did step-by-step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Extract Query Features**:\n",
    "We started by converting the spectrogram of the query track (represented as a 2D Boolean array, cmap) into a list of (frequency, time) points where the spectrogram is non-zero. These points represent prominent features in the audio.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Target Zone Generation**:\n",
    "For each anchor point in the query, we defined a \"target zone\" in the spectrogram, constrained by frequency and time offsets (time_min_offset, time_max_offset, freq_min_offset, and freq_max_offset). This allowed us to identify significant relationships between anchor points and their neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Hash Calculation**:\n",
    "We generated unique hashes for pairs of anchor and target points in the query. These hashes encapsulate the relationship between points in terms of time and frequency, enabling robust matching against the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Database Lookup**:\n",
    "For each hash, we checked if it exists in the database. If found, we retrieved the corresponding track and time offset information from the database. This step is crucial as it allows us to correlate features in the query with precomputed features in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Offset Analysis**:\n",
    "We grouped the matches by track name and analyzed their time offsets (delta values between query points and database points). For each track, we tracked how many points matched at the same offset, which is a key indicator of a correct match.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Best Match Identification**:\n",
    "Finally, we identified the track with the highest number of consistent matches (i.e., the highest count of points matching at the same offset). This track was returned as the best match, along with the corresponding offset and match count."

Larger zones result in more hashes being computed for each track, which increases memory usage, processing time, and query-matching overhead.
